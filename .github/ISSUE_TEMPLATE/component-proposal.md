## Summary

Describe the problem you're trying to solve or the opportunity you're looking to address.  Provide context about how the new component would improve the user experience or developer workflow.

## Detailed description

- **Functionality:** What functionality should the component include?  Consider interactive states, accessibility requirements and responsive behaviour.
