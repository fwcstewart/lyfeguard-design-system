# Lyfeguard Design System Docs

This package contains the Docusaurus documentation for the Lyfeguard Design System.  It is designed to provide a user‑friendly website where designers and developers can learn about tokens, foundations, components and patterns.

## Running the Docs Locally

To start the docs in development mode:

```bash
cd apps/docs
npm install
npm run dev
```

This command launches a development server at `http://localhost:3000` with hot reloading.  The site will automatically pick up Markdown files in the `docs` directory and pages in `src/pages`.

The docs use an autogenerated sidebar based on the structure of the `docs` folder.  Each Markdown file has front‑matter defining its `id` and `title`.  See the existing files in `docs/` for examples.

## Building & Deploying

To produce a static build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The compiled site will be output to the `build` directory.  You can deploy this folder to any static hosting service (for example GitHub Pages or Vercel).

## Structure

- **docs/** – Source Markdown files for the documentation.  The docs automatically generate a sidebar based on this directory.  Start with `introduction.md`, `foundations.md`, `components.md` and `layout.md`.
- **src/css/custom.css** – Custom CSS overrides for the Docusaurus theme.  We set the brand teal as the primary colour and adjust line heights here.
- **src/pages/index.tsx** – A simple homepage that links into the docs.

## Dependencies

The docs package depends on `@docusaurus/core` and `@docusaurus/preset-classic`, which are installed via `package.json`.  If you add MDX or other packages, install them locally within `apps/docs`.
