# Button

Buttons are used to trigger actions and navigate through the interface. They communicate what action will occur when the user interacts with them.

## Usage

Buttons should be used for:
- Primary actions (submit forms, save changes)
- Secondary actions (cancel, go back)
- Navigation (when styled as buttons)
- Destructive actions (delete, remove)

## Variants

- **Primary** - Main call-to-action buttons. Use for the most important action on a page.
- **Secondary** - Secondary actions. Use when you need multiple action options.
- **Tertiary** - Subtle actions. Use for less prominent actions or when you need to reduce visual weight.

## Sizes

- **Small (sm)** - For compact interfaces or inline actions
- **Medium (md)** - Default size for most use cases
- **Large (lg)** - For prominent calls-to-action

## States

Buttons support various states:
- **Default** - Normal interactive state
- **Hover** - When the cursor is over the button
- **Active** - When the button is being pressed
- **Focus** - When the button has keyboard focus
- **Disabled** - When the action is not available
- **Loading** - When an action is in progress

## Accessibility

- Buttons are keyboard accessible (Tab, Enter, Space)
- Focus indicators are clearly visible
- Disabled buttons are announced to screen readers
- Loading states are communicated to assistive technologies

## Examples

See the variants below for interactive examples of all button configurations.
