# Layout

Layout primitives provide the foundation for building consistent, responsive interfaces.

## Layout Components

- **Container** - Constrains content width and centers it on the page
- **Stack** - Vertical or horizontal stacking with consistent spacing
- **Grid** - Flexible grid system with configurable columns
- **GridItem** - Controls how many columns an item spans

## Spacing System

All layout components use the design system's spacing tokens for consistent rhythm:
- Use semantic spacing tokens (xs, sm, md, lg, xl)
- Spacing adapts responsively across breakpoints
- Dividers use theme-aware border colours

## Responsive Design

Layout components support responsive values:
- Base values apply to all screen sizes
- Override at specific breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl, xxl, widescreen)
- Breakpoints align with the design system's token system

## Best Practices

- Use Stack for simple vertical or horizontal layouts
- Use Grid for complex multi-column layouts
- Combine Stack and Grid for nested layouts
- Always use spacing tokens, never hard-code values
- Test layouts at different screen sizes
