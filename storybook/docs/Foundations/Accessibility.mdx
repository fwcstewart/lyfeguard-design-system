# Accessibility

Accessibility is a core principle of the Lyfeguard Design System. All components are designed to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## Keyboard Navigation

All interactive components support full keyboard navigation:
- Use `Tab` to move between interactive elements
- Use `Enter` or `Space` to activate buttons and controls
- Use arrow keys to navigate within groups (radio buttons, tabs, etc.)
- Use `Escape` to close modals and dismiss notifications

## Focus Management

- All interactive elements have visible focus indicators
- Focus is managed appropriately in modals and dialogs
- Focus traps prevent users from tabbing outside modal contexts

## ARIA Attributes

Components include appropriate ARIA attributes:
- `aria-label` for icon-only buttons
- `aria-describedby` for helper text
- `aria-expanded` for collapsible content
- `role` attributes where semantic HTML isn't sufficient

## Screen Reader Support

- All form inputs have associated labels
- Status messages are announced appropriately
- Loading states are communicated to assistive technologies
- Error messages are clearly associated with their inputs

## Color Contrast

All text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements:
- Normal text: 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Large text: 3:1 contrast ratio
- Interactive elements: 3:1 contrast ratio

## Testing

When using components, ensure:
- All functionality is accessible via keyboard
- Screen readers can navigate and understand the interface
- Color is not the only means of conveying information
- Focus indicators are visible and clear
